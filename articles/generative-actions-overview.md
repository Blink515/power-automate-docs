# Overview of generative actions

Generative actions are a new type of automation that's authored, tested, and executed through an AI runtime. You specify only the *intent* of the automation and the AI chooses the right set of actions in the right order based on your input, context, and intent.

## Benefits of generative actions

Generative actions simplify automation by reducing the need for detailed specifications, adapt to changing scenarios using AI intelligence, and handle complex tasks involving multiple steps and integrations.

- Generative actions can simplify and accelerate the automation process by reducing the need for specifying the conditions and action sets to execute.
- Generative actions can adapt to changing scenarios and data sources by leveraging the AI runtime's intelligence and reasoning capabilities.
- Generative actions can handle complex and dynamic tasks that involve multiple steps, conditions, loops, branches, and integrations.

## Author generative actions

You can author generative actions in the cloud flows designer in Power Automate. Upon giving the system an intent, the AI generates suggested inputs, outputs, and actions to use in the action. You can choose to accept the AI suggestions, or reject them and add your own inputs, outputs, and flow values.

In addition to inputs, outputs, and flow values, the system also provides connectors and actions that it can use to achieve its intended automation goal. You can choose to accept, reject, or add your own.

 Once you create the action, you can preview how it behaves by providing sample inputs and verifying  what the action does. In the preview phase, the action pauses before taking any action. You can run this multiple times. 

## Monitor a generative action

You can monitor your generative actions runs from the cloud flows run history. From the **My Flows** page, you can select  any flow to get to its manage page. This is where you can monitor the run history for the related generative action. To examine the process behind why a generative action called a specific action, you can dive into any run history instance.

## Edit or customize a generative action

To modify the instruction set or intent of a generative action at any time, select **Edit** in the flow design page.

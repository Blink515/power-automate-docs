# Application settings

You can change the application settings in the **Options** tab.

- **Change general settings:** In the **General** tab, change general settings such as the user interface language or set where the exported files will be stored. You can also define the default duration format used for all newly created processes and views. To learn more, go to [View settings](view-settings.md).

- **Change viewing preferences:** In the **Process explorer** tab, change the default settings for view creation processes. These settings will be used whenever a new process view is created.

- **Change process map and social chart settings:** In the **Process map** tab, change the default settings for displaying the process map and social graphs, such as spacing between nodes, displaying the start and end nodes, or chart alignment. These settings will be used whenever a new process view is created.

- **Change process animation settings:** In the **Animation** tab, change settings for process animation. These settings will be used as default, whenever a new process view is created.

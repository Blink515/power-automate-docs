# Configure Certificate-based authentication 

Power Automate allows users to [create credentials](create-AzureKeyVault-credentials.md) using **Certificate-based authentication** (preview). 
Entra-ID certificate-based authentication is one of the options that can allow customers to satisfy **Multifactor authentication (MFA) requirements**.

To get benefits of this feature, you will need first to follow the following pre-requisites.

> [!NOTE]
> These operations require Entra ID tenant admin.

## Enable CBA on the tenant

## (Optional) Entra ID CBA is configured to support validating MFA requirements

## Certificates are stored on a credential provider (AKV)
•	 format of the certificate  pfx

##	Admin consent (for unattended)

1. Admin authorisation – pairing machine 
1. Error code: need to link with the public doc
